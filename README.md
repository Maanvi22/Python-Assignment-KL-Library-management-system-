• There are three primary users, namely, Library Member (Non-Staff), Librarian (Staff), 
and System Administrator (Staff). Each will have their respective menu page that they 
can access with their given IDs, email addresses, and passwords. This also promotes 
access control, preventing users from accessing unauthorised data. 
 
• IDs for the users and books are random but unique. Member ID is in the “MEMnnnn” 
format, Librarians ID, “LIBnnnn”, Book ID, “Bnnnn”, where n represents a digit. 
 
 
• Only system administrators can edit members’ information and so only they can process 
payment of overdue return fees of members.

• Librarians can add new books into the catalogue, view existing books, search specific 
book, on request by members or to edit book information, and they can also remove 
books from the catalogue, if ever they are outdated or damaged. Librarians are also the 
one responsible for loaning books to members. 
 
• Members can process their handing in borrowed books, search books, view their 
personal profile by themselves. 
 
• Members can borrow up to five books. 
 
• When a member makes a payment, the librarian will edit this information in the system. 
 
• There is only 1 Super Admin Account, which the System Administrators can access. 
They would usually need to type in ‘admin’ as their username and password (code) 
change every hour, and only the administrators can access an authenticator application. 
For the simplicity of this system, the code is assigned as ‘12546’. 
 
• System Administrators can manage members’ accounts, that is, they can add new 
members’ information, view all members’ information, search member information, 
edit member information, and remove members from the system. 
 
• System Administrators can also manage librarians’ accounts, that is they can add new 
librarians’ information, view all librarians’ information, search librarian information, 
edit librarian information, and remove librarians from the system. 
 
 
• Data are stored in text files. 
 
• There are four files being used, namely, “MemberBorrowedBooksInfo.txt”, 
“availablebooks.txt”, “BookList.txt”, “librarians.txt”, “members.txt”. 
 
 
• Books borrowed should be returned within one week.
